## Description

### General
Project consists of two applications: Server app and Client app. <br>
Client application should be launched on victim's computer and server application should be launched on attacker's computer. <br>
Applications are connected to each other over the network using sockets mechanism. <br>
They imitate malicious software, which replaces banking account number (26 digits) which is located in victim's clipboard, to the malicious account number that was set on the server machine. Replacement of the clipboard's content occurs only when the victim tries to copy to the clipboard 26 digits number. <br>
Attacker can change malicious account number that will be copied to the victim's clipboard on the fly, without reseting either server or client application. <br>

Client Application runs two processes. The first one is responsible for checking the clipboard's content and replacing it when victim tries to copy a banking accout number. The second one is responsible for communication with the server applications via sockets. It listnes for commands to change malicious banking account number. <br>

Server Application runs only one process, however it relies on multiple threads.
  - Main thread is responsible for user interaction. It allows to change malicious banking accout number and to shut down server on the fly
  - Second thread is responsible for establishing socket connections with victims' computers. For each new connection it creates another thread which is responsible for this specific connection (So 'n' connections require 'n' new threads, ThreadPool was not implemented)



### Main features
  - Network Connection using sockets
  - Creating multiple processes
  - Creating multiple threads
  - Project is configured to work on localhost
  - One server can communicate with multiple clients at once, but only one malicious account number can be set for each victim
